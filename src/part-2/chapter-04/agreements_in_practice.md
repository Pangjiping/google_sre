## **Agreements in Practice**

## **实践中的SLA**

Crafting an SLA requires business and legal teams to pick appropriate consequences and penalties for a breach. SRE’s role is to help them understand the likelihood and difficulty of meeting the SLOs contained in the SLA. Much of the advice on SLO construction is also applicable for SLAs. It is wise to be conservative in what you advertise to users, as the broader the constituency, the harder it is to change or delete SLAs that prove to be unwise or difficult to work with.

拟定一个SLA需要业务和法律团队挑选适当的后果和违反的惩罚。SRE的作用是帮助他们理解满足SLA中的SLO的可能性和难度。许多关于SLO构架的建议也适用于SLA。明智的做法是，在向用户宣传时要保守，因为用户群越广，就越难改变或删除被证明是不明智或难以操作的SLA。

## **The End of the Beginning**

## **本章结语**

Site Reliability Engineering represents a significant break from existing industry best practices for managing large, complicated services. Motivated originally by familiarity —“as a software engineer, this is how I would want to invest my time to accomplish a set of repetitive tasks”—it has become much more: a set of principles, a set of practices, a set of incentives, and a field of endeavor within the larger software engineering discipline. The rest of the book explores the SRE Way in detail.

SRE代表了管理大型复杂服务的现有行业最佳实践的重大突破。最初由熟悉这个领域的软件工程师推动，这个领域已经发展成为更多的东西：一组原则、一套实践、一套激励机制以及更广泛软件工程学科中的一个领域。本书的剩余部分将详细探讨SRE的方法。

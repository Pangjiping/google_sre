# **前言**

Google’s story is a story of scaling up. It is one of the great success stories of the computing industry, marking a shift towards IT-centric business. Google was one of the first companies to define what business-IT alignment meant in practice, and went on to inform the concept of DevOps for a wider IT community. This book has been writ‐ ten by a broad cross-section of the very people who made that transition a reality.

谷歌的故事是一个扩大规模的故事。它是计算行业最伟大的成功案例之一，标志着向以IT为中心的业务的转变。谷歌是最早定义业务与IT一致性在实践中意味着什么的公司之一，并继续为IT社区传播更广泛的DevOps的概念。本书的作者来自各个领域，正是这些人使这种转变成为现实。

Google grew at a time when the traditional role of the system administrator was being transformed. It questioned system administration, as if to say: we can’t afford to hold tradition as an authority, we have to think anew, and we don’t have time to wait for everyone else to catch up. In the introduction to Principles of Network and System Administration [Bur99], I claimed that system administration was a form of humancomputer engineering. This was strongly rejected by some reviewers, who said “we are not yet at the stage where we can call it engineering.” At the time, I felt that the field had become lost, trapped in its own wizard culture, and could not see a way forward. Then, Google drew a line in the silicon, forcing that fate into being. The revised role was called SRE, or Site Reliability Engineer. Some of my friends were among the first of this new generation of engineer; they formalized it using software and automation. Initially, they were fiercely secretive, and what happened inside and outside of Google was very different: Google’s experience was unique. Over time, information and methods have flowed in both directions. This book shows a willingness to let SRE thinking come out of the shadows.

谷歌在系统管理员的传统角色发生转变的时候成长起来。谷歌质疑系统管理，好像在说：我们不能把传统当作权威，我们必须重新思考，我们没有时间等待其他人赶上来。在[网络和系统管理原理](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Principles+of+Network+and+System+Administration%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780470868072)的介绍中，我声称系统管理是人机工程的一种形式。这遭到了一些评论者的强烈反对，他们说“我们还没有达到可以称之为工程的阶段”。当时，我觉得这个领域迷失了方向，陷入了自己的巫师文化，看不到前进的方向。然后，谷歌在硅片上画了一条线，迫使这种命运成为现实。修改后的角色称为SRE，即站点可靠性工程师。我的一些朋友是新一代工程师中的第一批，他们使用软件和自动化将其形式化。最初，他们非常保密，谷歌内部和外部发生的事情非常不同：谷歌的经历是独一无二的。随着时间的推移，信息和方法已经双向流动。这本书表明了让SRE思想走出阴影的意愿。

Here, we see not only how Google built its legendary infrastructure, but also how it studied, learned, and changed its mind about the tools and the technologies along the way. We, too, can face up to daunting challenges with an open spirit. The tribal nature of IT culture often entrenches practitioners in dogmatic positions that hold the industry back. If Google overcame this inertia, so can we.

在这里，我们不仅看到了谷歌如何构建其传奇的基础架构，还看到了它如何研究、学习并改变其对工具和技术的看法。我们也可以以开放的精神面对艰巨的挑战。IT文化的部落性质常常使从业者固守教条立场，阻碍了行业发展。如果谷歌克服了这种惰性，那么我们也可以。

This book is a collection of essays by one company, with a single common vision. The fact that the contributions are aligned around a single company’s goal is what makes it special. There are common themes, and common characters (software systems) that reappear in several chapters. We see choices from different perspectives, and know that they correlate to resolve competing interests. The articles are not rigorous, academic pieces; they are personal accounts, written with pride, in a variety of personal styles, and from the perspective of individual skill sets. They are written bravely, and with an intellectual honesty that is refreshing and uncommon in industry literature. Some claim “never do this, always do that,” others are more philosophical and tentative, reflecting the variety of personalities within an IT culture, and how that too plays a role in the story. We, in turn, read them with the humility of observers who were not part of the journey, and do not have all the information about the myriad conflicting challenges. Our many questions are the real legacy of the volume: Why didn’t they do X? What if they’d done Y? How will we look back on this in years to come? It is by comparing our own ideas to the reasoning here that we can measure our own thoughts and experiences.

本书是一家公司的论文集，具有单一的共同愿景。这些贡献围绕一家公司的目标而调整，这一事实使其与众不同。有一些共同的主题和共同的角色（软件系统）在几章中重复出现。我们从不同的角度看待选择，并且知道它们与解决竞争利益相关。文章不严谨的学术文章，它们是以各种个人风格和个人技能组合的角度自由地撰写。这是一种非常大胆的写作，并且具有一种在行业文献中令人耳目一新且罕见的知识诚实。有些人声称“永远不要这样做，总是那样做”，有些人则更具哲理和尝试性，这反映了IT文化中的多样性，以及这在故事中如何发挥作用。反过来，我们以未参与旅程的观察者的谦逊态度阅读它们，并且不了解关于无数相互冲突的挑战的所有信息。我们的许多问题是该卷的真正财富：他们为什么不做X？如果他们做了Y怎么办？未来几年我们将如何回顾这件事？通过将我们自己的想法与这里的推理进行比较，我们可以衡量我们自己的想法和经验。

The most impressive thing of all about this book is its very existence. Today, we hear a brazen culture of “just show me the code.” A culture of “ask no questions” has grown up around open source, where community rather than expertise is championed. Google is a company that dared to think about the problems from first principles, and to employ top talent with a high proportion of PhDs. Tools were only components in processes, working alongside chains of software, people, and data. Nothing here tells us how to solve problems universally, but that is the point. Stories like these are far more valuable than the code or designs they resulted in. Implementations are ephemeral, but the documented reasoning is priceless. Rarely do we have access to this kind of insight.

这本书最令人印象深刻的是它的存在。今天，我们可以了解到一种厚颜无耻的文化，即“给我看代码”。一种“不问任何问题”的文化已经围绕开放源代码发展起来，在这种文化中，社区而不是专业知识受到拥护。谷歌是一家敢于从第一性原理思考问题，并且聘用博士比例高的顶尖人才的公司。工具只是流程中的组件，与软件、人员和数据链一起工作。这本书没有告诉我们如何普遍解决问题，但这就是重点。像这样的故事比它们产生的代码或设计更有价值。实现是短暂的，但记录在案的推理是无价的。我们很少有机会获得这种洞察力。

This, then, is the story of how one company did it. The fact that it is many overlapping stories shows us that scaling is far more than just a photographic enlargement of a textbook computer architecture. It is about scaling a business process, rather than just the machinery. This lesson alone is worth its weight in electronic paper.

那么，这就是一家公司如何做到这一点的故事。许多重复的经验向我们表明，规模增大不仅仅是教科书计算机体系结构的放大。它是关于扩展业务流程，而不仅仅是机器。仅此一课就值得在电子纸中发挥重要作用。

We do not engage much in self-critical review in the IT world; as such, there is much reinvention and repetition. For many years, there was only the USENIX LISA conference community discussing IT infrastructure, plus a few conferences about operating systems. It is very different today, yet this book still feels like a rare offering: a detailed documentation of Google’s step through a watershed epoch. The tale is not for copying—though perhaps for emulating—but it can inspire the next step for all of us. There is a unique intellectual honesty in these pages, expressing both leadership and humility. These are stories of hopes, fears, successes, and failures. I salute the courage of authors and editors in allowing such candor, so that we, who are not party to the hands-on experiences, can also benefit from the lessons learned inside the cocoon.

我们在IT世界中很少进行自我批评，因此有很多重新发明和重复。多年来，只有USENIX LISA会议社区在讨论IT基础设施，还有一些关于操作系统的会议。今天情况大不相同，但这本书仍然感觉像是一本难得的好书：详细记录了谷歌在一个分水岭时代的行为。这个故事不是用来复制的——尽管可能是用来模仿的——但它可以对我们所有人的下一步动作有所启发。在这本书中有一种独特的知识诚实，表达了领导力和谦逊。这些是关于希望、恐惧、成功和失败的故事。我向作者和编辑允许这种坦率的勇气致敬，这使得我们这些不参与实践经验的人也可以从中吸取的教训中受益。
